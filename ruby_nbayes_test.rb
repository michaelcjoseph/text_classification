  "A Guide to Religious Anarchy: Gershom Scholems Kabbalah When I was growing up, I saw my father letting the flame of his Jewish identity burn down as low as it could go without extinguishing altogether. He viewed all formal aspects of Judaism with bemused indifference, alternating with sarcastic hostility; practicing Jews, he said, were perfect examples of people who, however smart they might be, dont have enough sense to step inside when its raining. But my own experience of the American suburbs, where our family ended up at a moment when the remaining tracts of nature in the area were being steadily bulldozed and converted into new highways, malls, and subdivisions, left me with a lingering sense of spiritual absence. Almost all the history of my fathers family had been lost in the upheaval of their flight from Europe: I could not countenance the idea that our family would just step forever outside the nimbus or noose of Jewish identity as casually as it might step out of the car in a supermarket parking lot. I owed a debt to the dead, and I meant to pay. There was something intoxicating in the notion that I, the son of a non-Jewish mother and a non-observant father, might choose to blow on the flame of our Judaism through the actions of my own life, and so magnify its blaze no end.": "Tech",

Filipina helpers, says one agent, will follow your exact instructions, whereas locals are choosy and tend to handle only one task: if they clean, for instance, they will not look after children. Filipinas diligence makes them popular: the Philippine consulate in Hong Kong estimates that more than 200,000 undocumented Filipinas work as domestic helpers in China, earning 5,000 yuan ($728) per month, far more than they could make back home. As for legal troubles, the agents are reassuring: fines can be hefty but are rarely imposed. One agent admitted that a client was caught employing an illegal worker; the worker was sent home, but the client was not fined.Another Filipina no doubt took her place: the Philippines abounds with labour, and China needs domestic workers.

But in his new novel, Exit West, Mohsin Hamid, the author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist and How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, tells a story about migration in which the refugees journey is compressed into an instant. In the world of Exit West, migration doesnt involve rubber rafts or bloodied feet but, rather, doors that could take you elsewhere, often to places far away.": "Race & Culture",

She married a landsman, who became a diamond merchant; in the early nineteen-fifties, the couple resettled in the Bronx, and some fifteen years later, as empty-nesters, they went back to Israel.

This was, if anything, ahead of its forecast, which it reaffirmed, that rates would rise three times in 2017. Lift-off is at last an apt metaphor for monetary policy. But as Janet Yellen, the Feds chairwoman, picks up speed in terms of policy, she must navigate a cloudy political outlook. The next year will define her legacy.Ms Yellen took office in February 2014 after dithering by the Obama administration over a choice between her and Larry Summers, a former treasury secretary. Left-wingers preferred Ms Yellen, in part because she seemed more likely to give jobs priority over stable prices. Indeed, Republicans in Congress worried that she would be too soft on inflation.

The photos, providing only an accidental glimpse at the underside of Trumps tie, also provide a serviceable metaphor for the new Presidents relationship to being photographed. Trump is the most radically accessible President in American history: we have, via Twitter, a direct connection to what seems to be the animal portions of his brain.

Research showing that they sicken or kill bees and other pollinators has already prompted the European Union to temporary ban several varieties of the insecticides, and now neonics could lose their grip in North America, too.

It recently navigated sanctions against Russia to strike a deal with Rosneft, the countrys oil champion.Yet Glencore could still acquire a halo for itself. It is one of the worlds biggest suppliers of copper and the biggest of cobalt, much of which comes from its investment in the DRC. These are vital ingredients for clean-tech products and industries, notably electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries.The potential of green metals and minerals, which along with copper and cobalt include nickel, lithium and graphite, is adding to renewed excitement about investing in mining firms as they emerge from the wreckage of a $1trn splurge of over-investment during the China-led commodities supercycle, which began in the early 2000s.

  "Ornette Colemans Inspired Soundtrack for Whos Crazy? The excessive interest in film scores is as bad for music as it is for movies. Most movie music is dull to listen to on its own, no matter how well it enhances the film in which its deployed. With relatively few exceptions, the best effects that scores can have are subliminal, fused with and inseparable from the over-all experience of the movie. Thats because, for the most part, music is used in movies as sonic wallpaper, covering silences and images with an indifferent and casually factitious unity. Thats also why, for the most part, what makes movie music distinctive isnt so much the composition itself as the way that its used. Creative soundtracks take musical pieces that might otherwise be only adequate, or at least not significantly better than other scores, and elevate them to the realm of the filmmakers own artistry. On the other hand, the use of great music in movies poses an exceptional challenge for filmmakers, who must make a movie thats worthy of its soundtrack, and use the scores in a way that rivals the music itself in creative originality.": "Race & Culture",

His quoting of the rap trio Migos, however ironically, was pointed. Whereas hip-hop could bring joy to the masses while retaining a sense of experimental play, perhaps indie rock had become too refined and effete, increasingly detached from lived, earned experience. The post, which Longstreth later downplayed as a jokey riff on fake critical theory language, inspired a range of responses, most notably from Robin Pecknold, the lead singer of Fleet Foxes, who wondered if indie remained a useful distinction at all. What mattered, he contended, was that music, whether aspiring to sound vintage or progressive, still possessed the capacity to conjure a new feeling in its listeners.": "Race & Culture",

  "Rereading Paula Foxs Desperate Characters There can be a fine line between turning to the literature of the past for insight into our own times and bending its messages into the ones that our ears are most eager to hear. After I learned that the writer Paula Fox had died last week, at the age of ninety-three, I took out my copy of Desperate Characters, her best-known novel, wary of the temptation to indulge in solipsistic interpretation. Desperate Characters is partly about gentrification in New York, an inescapable fact of life in the city as we live it now. But it was published in 1970, and so the late-sixties New York it describes—seedy and decrepit, its abandoned streets blowsy with garbage and drunks—is many moons from our own hale town bursting with chain-store, starchitect vigor. There was no need to worry. The novel—tense, quick, prickling with suppressed panic—is very much of its time and has a lot to say to ours, too.

  "The coming revolution in insurance IN THE stormy and ever-changing world of global finance, insurance has remained a relatively placid backwater. With the notable exception of AIG, an American insurer bailed out by the taxpayer in 2008, the industry rode out the financial crisis largely unscathed. Now, however, insurers face unprecedented competitive pressure owing to technological change. This pressure is demanding not just adaptation, but transformation.The essential product of insurance—protection, usually in the form of money, when things go wrong—has few obvious substitutes. Insurers have built huge customer bases as a result. Investment revenue has provided a reliable boost to profits. This easy life led to a complacent refusal to modernise. The industry is still astonishingly reliant on human labour. Underwriters look at data but plenty still rely on human judgment to evaluate risks and set premiums. Claims are often reviewed manually.The march of automation and technology is an opportunity for new entrants. Although starting a new soup-to-nuts insurer from scratch is rare (see Continue reading": "Business",
  "The Complicated Friendship of H. P. Lovecraft and Robert Barlow, One of His Biggest Fans On June 18, 1931, a young man named Robert Barlow mailed a letter to the horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. Lovecrafts stories about monstrous beings from beyond the stars were appearing regularly in the pulp magazine Weird Tales, and Barlow was a fan. He wanted to know when Lovecraft had started writing, what he was working on now, and whether the Necronomicon—a tome of forbidden knowledge that appears in several Lovecraft tales—was a real book. A week later, Lovecraft wrote back, as he nearly always did. Its estimated that he wrote more than fifty thousand letters in his relatively short lifetime (he died at the age of forty-six). This particular letter was the beginning of a curious friendship, which changed the course of Barlows life, and Lovecrafts, too—though almost no one who reads Lovecraft these days knows anything about it.

Neither has the companys understanding of Zeldas essential purpose: to bring the great outdoors—the rollicking hills, the whispering caves, all that breezy, alfresco escapade—indoors. In recent years, Miyamoto, who is now sixty-four, has retreated to the position of Zeldas overseer, relinquishing control to younger directors inside the clandestine, Willy Wonka-esque factory that is Nintendos Kyoto headquarters.

  "The end of secular stagnation? IN PERIODS of economic stress all sorts of theories are entertained about the nature of the problem. When better times return, some theories fade from memory. Others linger, however. During the economic mess of the past decade, economists frightened themselves with tales of secular stagnation: a nasty condition that dooms its victims to chronically weak growth. Now that the economic outlook is brightening a bit—deflation has been dispatched, and for most advanced economies 2017 is forecast to bring a third consecutive year of economic growth—it is tempting to laugh off the idea of secular stagnation as a bit of crisis-induced hysteria. Tempting, but also premature.In a time of secular stagnation, the normal relationship between saving and investment goes haywire. People save some portion of their income each year. Because one persons spending is anothers income, such saving can drain away demand and lead to recession, unless the funds set aside by savers are reinjected into the economy through lending to those looking to invest: as when banks lend savers deposits to businesses, for example. Central banks help manage this...Continue reading": "Business",

The film, which shot to No. 1 at the box office, brazenly inhabits the anxieties that surround miscegenation in our still racially stratified country.

He stopped to chat with a few people he knew or who knew him—his old trainer, someone from his high school—and showed me the ramshackle blue house (the former MTV beach house) that was Snapchats original office. For Spiegel, who grew up in the Los Angeles neighborhood of the Pacific Palisades and was still living at his fathers house there when I met him, being in the flow of the boardwalks heavy foot traffic was good for product development. He told USA Today, We can come out and talk to Snapchatters all year along, and thats really important.

  "Was Barcelonas win the greatest comeback in Champions League history? THE CAMP Nou erupted. A late winning goal is enough to send any football crowd into raptures. But three? That was how many Barcelona required as the 90th minute approached on March 8th, in the second leg of a Champions League knockout tie against Paris Saint-Germain.The Catalan club had already been routed in the first leg, losing 4-0 in a woeful performance away at the Parc des Princes on February 14th. Barças faint hopes of qualifying for the quarter-final were dampened further still by the away-goals rule: if the aggregate scores across the two legs are level at the end of the tie, the side which has bagged more goals away from home progresses. And sure enough, after the home side raced out to a 3-0 lead, Edinson Cavani, Paris Saint-Germains centre-forward, drove a volley into the roof of their net in the 62nd minute. That meant that Barcelona would have to beat them by five, leaving them three goals short with about half an hour to go. They failed to score any for the next 26 minutes.Only when the 88th minute arrived did the floodgates open. Neymar won a free-kick 30 yards from goal, and arrowed it into the top corner. Two minutes later Luis Suárez,...Continue reading": "Race & Culture",

  "When the Oppens Gave Up Art to Fight Fascism Late in 1935, the artist Mary Oppen and her husband, George, a poet, made a decision. The young couple had recently returned to New York after several years abroad. In Europe, they had read the signs. Jews were fleeing Germany; in Italy, Mussolini was an object of worship. Back in the United States, which they had left in 1929, they were startled by the changes wrought by the Depression. At stoplights, grown men, respectable men—our fathers—stepped forward to ask for a nickel, rag in hand to wipe our windshield, Mary recalls in her memoir, Meaning a Life, which was published in 1978. Though they had always been leftists, Mary and George now wanted to find an organization with which they could ally themselves. They spoke with the son of the founder of the Socialist Labor Party. They listened to Trotskyites. And then, at the Seventh World Congress of the Communist International, the Communist Party proclaimed a Popular Front against Fascism. This, for George and Mary, was a turning point. We said to each other, Lets work with the unemployed and leave our interest in the arts for a later time,  Mary writes.": "Tech",
